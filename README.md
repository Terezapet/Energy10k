# Energy10k: Measuring Regulatory Exposure in 10-K Filings

This repository contains code, documentation, and analysis from a text-as-data project aimed at identifying and classifying **environmental and energy regulatory language** in corporate 10-K filings. The project uses a combination of manual coding, supervised learning, topic modeling, and large language models (LLMs) to develop replicable measures of regulatory exposure across industries.

## üîç Project Overview

Many companies disclose regulatory risks in their annual 10-K filings, particularly in the **Item 1A: Risk Factors** section. This project extracts those sections, preprocesses the text, and analyzes them using a suite of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning tools.

The ultimate goal is to build a scalable pipeline to **quantify regulatory discourse**, distinguish between **energy vs. environmental regulation**, and explore **variation across sectors and government levels (federal, state, local)**.
